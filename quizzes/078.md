    for i in range(len(bits)):
        sum += 2**i * bits[i]
    if sum == 80 or sum == 22123:
        error = "Allowed"
        msg = data[16:]
    else:
        error = "Filtered"
        msg = None
    return error, msg
```

*i don't know the test cases as the quiz was not published on the slides
