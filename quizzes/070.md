START

  FOR u in 255:
    ip[1] = u

*my laptop almost explodes trying to print 4^4 = 256^4 = 4,294,967,296 combinations of IPs

Here is a simplified version of the program:
```.py
def ipv4machine():
    out = []
    for i in range(3):
        for u in range(3):
            for e in range(3):
                for a in range(3):
                    ip = [i, u, e, a]
                    out.append(ip)
    return out

my_ips = ipv4machine()
print(my_ips)
```
